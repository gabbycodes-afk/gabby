My name is Kolade. I’m from Osun State, Nigeria, and I’m currently a student at Miva Open University where I’m studying Software Engineering. I’m also learning fullstack and software development. Even though I don’t feel like I’m doing much sometimes, I know deep down that I want something more out of life, and that’s why I’ve taken the steps I have.

To be honest, there are days I feel unmotivated, unproductive, or even useless. I don’t really have hobbies, and I’m still trying to figure out who I am and what I enjoy. But even in all that confusion, I still show up I attend my classes, I try to learn, and I haven’t quit. That has to count for something.

I may not feel proud of myself right now, but I’m aware that I’m on a journey. Things don’t change overnight, and growth doesn’t always feel good. But the fact that I’m still here, still pushing through, means I haven’t given up. And that’s a start.

I believe my story is still unfolding. I don’t have it all figured out, but I’m slowly learning that it’s okay to be a work in progress. I’m learning to be patient with myself, to keep trying, and to allow myself to grow even if it’s one small step at a time.
